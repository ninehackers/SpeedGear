This is the designed URI between Android agents and the server side:

__version__ = "0.1"

1.	list all the users
	[In]	/user?action=listall
	[Out]   {"errorMsg": "Successfull", "users": ["alice", "bob"]}

2.	add a new user
	[In]    /user?action=add&name=alice
    [Out]   {"errorMsg": "add user success for: alice"}

3.	get the location for user
    [In]    /location?action=getlatestlocation&name=alice

4.	report the location to server for user
    [In]    location?action=reportlocation&name=alice&location={"longitude":"123.234","dimension":"987.876"}
